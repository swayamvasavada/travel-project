                        <p>Hawaii is known for its beautiful beaches—some of them with unusual colors. Many beaches are
                            filled with white sand, but other Hawaiian shores are covered with green, red, pink, and
                            even black sand. Whether you like hiking, biking, kayaking, sailing, swimming, or just
                            sitting on the beach, Hawaii is the state for you.
